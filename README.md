## Comments
- I just noticed that my information rate wasn't working proeperly in the code I had saved as I had changed how my code worked, meaning the noise level was being taken from the wrong part
- I just changed it back so it should be working now
- However, the data in my table in my report is slightly wrong, all the values are slightly off where they should be
- It is past the due date so I will not change it
- The explanation however is still valid, as the rates still follow the same patterns (decreasing by noise levels and icnreasing then decreasing with latent dims)
- It is just worth to note in case you run the experiment, as the results (which have now been corrected) will differ slightly from the results I provided
